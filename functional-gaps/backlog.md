# Mock DID ION Service - Functional Gaps

This document lists the functional gaps in the Mock DID ION Service that need to be addressed to meet the PDS3.0 specification.

## DID Creation Gaps

- Signature verification is missing
- Proper key validation is incomplete
- Support for different key types is limited
- No validation against ION schema

## DID Resolution Gaps

- DID document construction is basic
- Missing proper caching
- Error handling is incomplete
- No support for resolving external DIDs

## Anchoring Gaps

- Simulated anchoring doesn't match real ION
- Missing consensus simulation
- No simulation of transaction batching
- Time-delay simulation is simplistic

## Operation Model Gaps

- Create operation is incomplete
- Update operation is basic
- Recover operation is missing
- Deactivate operation is not implemented

## Security Gaps

- No validation of operation signatures
- Missing protection against replay attacks
- No simulation of Sidetree security measures
- Key revocation handling is missing

## IPFS Simulation Gaps

- Content-addressing simulation is basic
- No proper CID generation
- IPFS pinning simulation is missing
- No support for IPFS network simulation

## Network Simulation Gaps

- No simulation of network latency
- Missing simulation of network errors
- No support for rate limiting
- Missing simulation of node synchronization

## Integration Gaps

- Missing integration with wallet applications
- No support for external anchoring services
- Missing webhooks for notifications
- Limited monitoring capabilities
